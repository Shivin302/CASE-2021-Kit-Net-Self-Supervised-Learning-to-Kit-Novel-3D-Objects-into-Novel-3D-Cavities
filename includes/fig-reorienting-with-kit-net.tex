  \caption{\AB{this figure needs some labels, eg. $I^s$, $\hat{I}^g$, $I^g$}\textbf{Reorienting Objects with Kit-Net: }Kit-Net aligns objects from $I^s$ (left) to $\hat{I}^g$ (middle) given both positive (top right) and negative (bottom right) goal images $I^g$ by estimating ${_s}\hat{t}^g \in SE(3)$. Positive goal images are generated as described in Section~\ref{subsubsec:real-positive} while negative goal images are generated as described in Section~\ref{subsubsec:real-negative}.}
